# Flatland
Virtual 2-D environment

Flatland is a library that allows you to create a virtual 2-D environment in
which you can put and move one or more virtual sensors to get virtual range
measures.

Moving the sensors into this virtual space (really a plan) you can test your
[SLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping) 
or navigation algorithms.

The name Flatland is after the romance
["Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland)
by  Edwin Abbott Abbott.

This romance describes a flat world populated by geometric figures that live
and act as persons.
