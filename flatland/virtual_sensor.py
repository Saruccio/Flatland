"""
The VirtualDevice class takes into account that in a physical world, the
The sensor is positioned on one reference system that moves over another.

In the simplest case, the sensor reference system moves with respect to the one
on which it is mounted.

In more complicated cases, the reference system of the sensor moves with respect
to another reference system which in turn moves with respect of another one
and so on.

Therefore, VirtualDevice aims to take into account the movements of stacked
reference systems and places the sensor on the correct absolute
position in the global reference system in order to perform a right simulated
measurement.

The VirtualDevice class so extends the Sensor classadding to it physical
information.
